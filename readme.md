# g3pd - Gen 3 Pokemon Display

## What?

This script allows streamers to display their current party to their viewers.

## Setup

1. Get [Viusal Boy Advanced Rerecording](https://github.com/TASVideos/vba-rerecording/releases) if you don't already use it.

2. [Get the latest version of g3pd](https://github.com/PeachIceTea/g3pd/archive/master.zip).

3. Get sprites you like. I used [these](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads). The files need to be either named after the pokemon or be their national pokedex id. Sprites have the following additional requirements:

    3.1 A "0.png" that matches the dimensions of the other sprites, but is emtpy.

    3.2 An "egg.png" for, well, eggs.

    3.3 For Dark Rising only named sprites are supported.

4. Extract g3pd into its own folder.

5. Extract the sprites into the "sprites" folder.

6. Use a text editor to set the game in the "SetGameInHere.lua" file. 1 for Emerald, 2 for FireRed/LeafGreen, and 3 for Dark Rising.

7. Run VBA and when the game is loaded, load the script from Tools/Lua Scripting/New Lua Script Window...

8. Add the png files in the "party" folder to your OBS overlay.
