# g3pd - Gen 3 Pokemon Display

## What?
This script allows streamers to display their current party to their viewers.

## Setup
1. Get [Viusal Boy Advanced Rerecording](https://github.com/TASVideos/vba-rerecording/releases) if you don't already use it.

2. [Get the latest version of g3pd](https://github.com/PeachIceTea/g3pd/archive/master.zip).

3. Get sprites you like. I used [these](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads). Also, there needs to be a 0.png that matches the dimensions of the other sprites but is emtpy. For eggs there needs to be a egg.png.

4. Extract g3pd into its own folder.

5. Extract the sprites into the "sprites" folder.

6. Run VBA and when the game is loaded. Load the script from Tools/Lua Scripting/New Lua Script Window...

7. Add the png files in the "party" folder to your OBS overlay.

## Note
Currently only Pokemon Emerald (USA) is supported. Please open an issue if you need a version for other games.
